2. Software/Application Development: Create AAC software or apps that incorporate text-to-speech, symbol-based communication, and, if applicable, ISL gestures.
3. Testing and Refinement: Test the AAC tools with individuals with communication disabilities and gather feedback for refinement.
4. Distribution and Implementation: Make the AAC tools available for users, educators, and caregivers. Provide training on their use.

**Learnings:**
- In-depth knowledge of AAC strategies and technologies.
- Understanding of communication needs in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.
- Software development skills, especially for mobile platforms.
- Expertise in accessibility standards and guidelines.
- Experience in inclusive education and assistive technology.

**Strategy/Plan:**
1. Research and Content Development: Collaborate with speech pathologists, special educators, and linguists to understand communication needs. Develop a comprehensive set of AAC content, including symbols, pictures, and language options.
2. Software/Application Development: Create user-friendly AAC software or apps with a focus on accessibility and customization.
3. Testing and Refinement: Pilot the AAC tools with a diverse group of users, including those with various communication disabilities. Collect feedback and make necessary adjustments.
4. Distribution and Implementation: Partner with schools, rehabilitation centers, and disability organizations to distribute the AAC tools. Provide training to users and caregivers.

Developing AAC tools for the Indian context requires a multidisciplinary approach to ensure that communication needs are effectively addressed.
