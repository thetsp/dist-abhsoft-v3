- Machine Learning Engineers
- Data Analysts
- Call Center Representatives
- Software Developers

**Timeframe:**
- Data Collection and Preparation: 1-2 months
- Model Development: 3-4 months
- Testing and Fine-tuning: 2-3 months
- Deployment and Integration: 1-2 months

**Scope:**
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Collect a diverse dataset of recorded calls with associated sentiments.
   - Annotate the dataset to label calls as positive, negative, or neutral.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Build an NLP model for sentiment analysis using techniques like text classification.
   - Train the model on the annotated dataset to understand context and sentiment.

3. **Testing and Fine-tuning:**
   - Test the model on a variety of call recordings to evaluate its accuracy.
   - Fine-tune the model based on the feedback from call center representatives.

4. **Integration with Helpdesk System:**
   - Integrate the sentiment analysis model with the helpdesk system.
   - Automatically analyze incoming call audio in real-time and determine sentiment.

5. **Real-time Feedback to Call Center Agents:**
   - Provide real-time sentiment analysis results to call center representatives.
   - Agents can receive insights about callers' sentiments before interacting with them.

6. **Reporting and Insights:**
   - Generate reports and analytics on call sentiment trends over time.
   - Identify common pain points and areas for improvement in customer service.

**Technology Stack:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
- Machine Learning Frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Real-time Audio Processing Tools

**Learnings:**
- Gain insights into the effectiveness of sentiment analysis models for call centers.
- Understand challenges related to audio data processing and sentiment interpretation.

**Strategy/Plan:**
1. Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of call recordings and sentiment labels.
2. Model Development: Build and train an NLP model for sentiment analysis.
3. Testing and Feedback: Evaluate model performance and gather feedback.
4. Integration: Integrate the model with the helpdesk system for real-time analysis.
5. Real-time Insights: Provide sentiment analysis results to call center agents.
6. Reporting: Generate reports and trends based on sentiment analysis results.
