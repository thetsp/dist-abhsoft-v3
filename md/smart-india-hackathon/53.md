**Problem Statement Title:** Text-to-Video Generation of PIB Press Releases in Multiple Languages

**Description:** Develop an AI-powered system that can convert text-based Press Information Bureau (PIB) press releases into videos with voiceovers in English and 13 regional languages. The system should utilize AI, ML, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create visually appealing and accurate videos.
