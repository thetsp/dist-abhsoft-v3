**Problem Statement Title:** Automated Reservoir Inflow Estimation and Controlled Release for Flood Mitigation

**Description:** This challenge involves creating an automated system that estimates the inflow to a reservoir based on various factors such as rainfall, soil moisture in the catchment area, and releases from upstream reservoirs. The system should also regulate the opening of reservoir gates to release water in a controlled manner, aimed at preventing flooding in the basin.
