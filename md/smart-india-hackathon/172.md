**Problem Statement Title:** Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generation Tool for Custom-Developed Software

**Description:** Create a comprehensive software tool capable of generating a complete Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for custom-developed software, including in-house projects by organizations. This tool should facilitate the identification and documentation of all components and dependencies within the software.

**Domain:** Software Development, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity

**Solution Proposal:**

**Resources Needed:**
- Software Developers
- Cybersecurity Experts
- Project Managers
- Software Development Tools and Libraries
- Testing Environments

**Timeframe:**
- Research and Development: 12-18 months
- Testing and Validation: 6-12 months
- Deployment and Integration: Ongoing

**Technology/Tools:**
- Programming Languages (e.g., Python, Java)
- Software Development Frameworks (e.g., Django, Spring)
- Dependency Scanning Tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check)
- Database Systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Version Control Systems (e.g., Git)
- Containerization Technologies (e.g., Docker)

**Team Size:**
- Software Developers: 3-5
- Cybersecurity Experts: 2-3
- Project Managers: 1-2
- Testing and Validation Team: 2-3

**Scope:**
1. Requirement Analysis: Gather requirements from organizations for custom-developed software SBOM generation.
2. Design and Development: Create a user-friendly tool that identifies and documents all software components and dependencies.
3. Dependency Scanning: Implement automated dependency scanning to discover third-party libraries and their vulnerabilities.
4. Database Integration: Develop a database to store SBOM data securely.
5. User Interface: Design an intuitive web-based interface for users to interact with the tool.
6. Testing and Validation: Rigorously test the tool for accuracy and security.
7. Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation on tool usage, installation, and integration.
8. Deployment: Assist organizations in deploying the tool within their development environments.
9. Support and Updates: Offer ongoing support and updates to adapt to changing software landscapes.

**Learnings:**
- Profound understanding of software development and cybersecurity.
- Expertise in designing tools for SBOM generation.
- Knowledge of best practices in software documentation and security.

**Strategy/Plan:**
1. Requirement Analysis: Collaborate closely with organizations to understand their software development processes and SBOM needs.
2. Design and Development: Create a robust SBOM generation tool using best practices in software development.
3. Dependency Scanning: Integrate dependency scanning to automatically identify third-party components.
4. Database Integration: Develop a secure database for storing SBOM data.
5. User Interface: Design an intuitive web interface for user interaction.
6. Testing and Validation: Perform extensive testing and security audits.
7. Documentation: Create user and developer documentation.
8. Deployment: Assist organizations in deploying the tool within their development workflows.
9. Support and Updates: Provide ongoing support and updates to address evolving software requirements and security concerns.

This initiative aims to help organizations ensure the transparency, security, and compliance of their custom-developed software through the generation of comprehensive SBOMs.
