**Problem Statement Title:** Automated Public Lighting System

**Description:** The challenge is to develop an automated public lighting system that intelligently controls streetlights to optimize energy usage, reduce light pollution, and enhance overall efficiency. The system should be capable of adjusting light intensity based on real-time factors such as ambient light levels, pedestrian and vehicle presence, and time of day. Additionally, it should allow for remote monitoring and management to promptly address maintenance issues.
