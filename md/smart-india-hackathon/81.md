**Problem Statement Title:** Image Correctness for a Product on Marketplace

**Description:** Create a solution that automatically verifies the correctness and quality of product images uploaded by sellers on an online marketplace to enhance customer experience and trust.

**Domain:** E-commerce, Image Processing, Quality Assurance

**Solution Proposal:**

**Resources Needed:**
- Image Processing Experts
- Software Developers
- Quality Assurance Analysts

**Timeframe:**
- Data Collection and Preparation: 2-3 months
- Model Development: 3-4 months
- Testing and Fine-tuning: 2-3 months
- Deployment and Reporting: 1-2 months

**Scope:**
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Gather a diverse dataset of product images from the marketplace.
   - Annotate images with labels indicating correctness and quality.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Develop a deep learning model to analyze and assess image correctness.
   - Train the model on the annotated dataset to identify common correctness issues.

3. **Testing and Fine-tuning:**
   - Test the model on a wide range of product images.
   - Refine the model based on feedback and accuracy improvements.

4. **Deployment and Reporting:**
   - Integrate the model into the marketplace's image upload process.
   - Provide sellers with real-time feedback on image correctness.

5. **Quality Assurance Enhancement:**
   - Automatically flag incorrect or poor-quality images for manual review.
   - Ensure that product images meet marketplace standards.

6. **Customer Trust and Experience:**
   - Improve customer trust by ensuring accurate and representative images.
   - Enhance the overall shopping experience by reducing misleading images.

**Technology Stack:**
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Image Analysis
- Image Processing Libraries (e.g., OpenCV)
- Cloud Infrastructure for Deployment (e.g., AWS, Azure)

**Learnings:**
- Gain insights into common image correctness issues in an e-commerce context.
- Understand the complexities of developing image analysis models for quality assurance.

**Strategy/Plan:**
1. Data Collection: Collect and annotate a diverse dataset of product images.
2. Model Development: Build and train a CNN model for image correctness assessment.
3. Testing and Refinement: Evaluate model performance on a variety of images.
4. Deployment: Integrate the model into the image upload process on the marketplace.
5. Quality Enhancement: Automatically flag incorrect or poor-quality images for review.
6. Customer Experience: Improve trust and experience by ensuring accurate images.
