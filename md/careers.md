3. Our Team will contact with you to get to know you better and understand your qualifications and experience

4. As part of our selection process, we conduct two practical interviews of 2 hours each, focusing on evaluating your hands-on skills rather than theoretical knowledge. These interviews are designed to assess your proficiency in CSS and JavaScript, which are essential for the Front End Developer role.

    - Interview 1 CSS: In this interview, our interviewer will evaluate your CSS skills by providing a short demo of prebuilt websites. Your task will be to replicate the provided design by applying CSS concepts such as the box model, flexbox, grid, animations, effects, transitions, and media queries. This exercise will allow us to gauge your ability to create visually appealing and responsive layouts.

    - Interview 2 JavaScript: During the second interview, our focus will be on your JavaScript skills. You will be given the opportunity to add interactivity and functionality to the website you built in the first interview. Our interviewer will assess your proficiency in DOM manipulations, event handling, advanced effects, transitions, drag and drop functionality, canvas usage, 3D designs, and forms handling. This interview aims to understand your ability to create dynamic and engaging user experiences.

5. Once the practical interviews are completed, our team will thoroughly assess your skills and qualifications. If your performance impresses our interviewer and aligns with the expectations for the Front End Developer role, you will receive a notification via email confirming your selection within the next 2 days.

6. However, if, for any reason, your application is not selected, we believe in transparent communication. We will promptly inform you about the outcome of the interviews and the decision to not proceed with your application.

7. In the event of rejection, we want to encourage continuous growth and improvement. You will have the opportunity to reapply for the Front End Developer role after a waiting period of 6 months. During this time, we encourage you to enhance your skills and qualifications, so that your future applications can demonstrate further progress.
